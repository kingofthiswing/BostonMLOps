issue- wasnt able to install venv.
sol-updated conda and tried again it worked

Steps performed Jan 10th
- Created venv

- Created Readme file and pushed to git
- Created .gitignore file on github set language python and pulled it in vscode
- created setup.py (search google setup.py to find out what it is)
- under main folder create src folder
